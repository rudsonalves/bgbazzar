**Refactor: Rename Login Feature to SignIn and Implement SignInStore for State Management**

This commit introduces major refactoring by renaming the existing login feature to signin, in order to align naming conventions with other features. The changes include modifications in controllers, screens, widgets, and routes. The state management previously handled by ChangeNotifier has also been migrated to use SignInStore, enhancing separation of concerns and improving maintainability.

### Changes Overview:

1. **Renaming Files and Classes: Login to SignIn**
   - Renamed the login feature directory and relevant files (e.g., `login_controller.dart` to `signin_controller.dart`, `login_screen.dart` to `signin_screen.dart`).
   - Updated class names and imports across the application to reflect the new naming scheme (e.g., `LoginController` to `SignInController`, `LoginScreen` to `SignInScreen`).

2. **Deleted Legacy State Management Classes**
   - Removed `login_state.dart` that contained old state definitions like `LoginStateInitial`, `LoginStateLoading`, etc.
   - Updated state handling from using abstract classes to using the new store-based approach.

3. **Introduction of `SignInStore`**
   - Created a new `signin_store.dart` file for state management.
   - Implemented `SignInStore` using `ValueNotifier` to manage state (`PageState`) and validation errors (e.g., `errorEmail`, `errorPassword`).
   - Integrated `SignInStore` within `SignInController` for streamlined state management.

4. **Simplified Form Widgets**
   - Removed `LoginForm` widget and created `SignInForm` which now uses `SignInStore` for validation and state handling.
   - `SignInForm` is now directly responsible for managing the user input fields (`email` and `password`) through `ValueListenableBuilder` for reactive UI updates.

5. **Route Updates**
   - Replaced all references to `LoginScreen.routeName` with `SignInScreen.routeName` throughout the application.
   - Updated the navigation logic in `shop_screen.dart` and `my_material_app.dart` accordingly.

6. **Miscellaneous Cleanup**
   - Removed redundant focus nodes and controllers from `SignupController`, simplifying the code by directly leveraging the `SignupStore`.
   - Adjusted the signup workflow to ensure a smoother user experience, reflecting the new store-based state management paradigm.

### Conclusion:
This refactoring aligns the feature names, improves readability, and introduces a more scalable state management approach using stores. The change also unifies the naming convention with other parts of the project, thereby improving code consistency and maintainability moving forward.

## 2024/08/06 - version: 0.6.5+28

Implement Favorite Button and User-Specific Features, Improve Scrolling and Mechanics Handling

The favorite button now appears only for logged-in users and is positioned over the product images in the current layout. On the "My Ads" page, buttons to edit and delete an ad are available, but only for ads with a pending or sold status. Active products cannot be edited or deleted. In the ShopScreen, reactivity has been added to adjust the display of favorites and the page header name based on whether the user is logged in or not.

Scrolling adjustments have been made to the ShopGridView and AdListView widgets to ensure smoother scrolling when loading new ads. The control of mechanics has been migrated from the Parse server to a local SQLite database. These mechanics consist of relatively static information that does not change frequently, hence they have been incorporated into the app. Data from BGG and the annual ranking table have also been integrated into the application.

These changes enhance user-specific features and optimize the handling of mechanics by migrating data control to a local SQLite database. The integration of user-specific features and the optimization of mechanics handling ensure a more efficient and user-friendly experience. This set of changes introduces significant improvements to user interactions, performance enhancements, and the transition to local storage for mechanics, providing a more robust and efficient application experience.

Deletions primarily focus on removing configuration files and setups specific to Flutter's macOS, windows and Linux descktop implementations, cleaning up the project and reducing dependencies. Additional deletions continue the clean-up process by removing configuration files and assets specific to the macOS platform, further simplifying the project and focusing on the core Flutter application. The final batch of deletions completes the removal of configuration files, scripts, and assets specific to the macOS and Windows platforms.
